# PartKeepr-NG Code of Ethics
## **The Goal**
To make PartKeepr-NG the best piece of Open Source Software both us (the Developers) and you guys (the Contributors) can make for everyone to use. In doing so, there has to be a few common sense guidelines for all of us to follow to make that as easy as we can.

## **1.) Quality Code First, _always_**
This is a bunch of files and scripts, written by a lot of people from all over the world, with various and extensive backgrounds and individual traits that are too numerous to list in this document. All that matters in all of that is the _**Quality of the Code in the PR**_. If it's:
* Well documented, easily readable, and follows the coding practices of the Project
* Properly tested
* Correctly submitted as a Pull Request

There's a good chance we will review it and, pending any serious issues, pull it into the main code base. If there are any concerns or questions, or if you need help with anything to make sure it follow the above points, we (or someone) will happily help you with that.

## **2.) We are all able to have _Adult Conversations_**
We are all different, and there will be points where someone won't agree with another person's views, actions, or criticisms. We will be _**civilized**_ and discuss it like _**Adults**_, and not resort to mob mentality or witch-hunting. Simply put:
* Degrading another person for any reason
* Purposefully targeting a person or group of people in a negative way
* Being toxic for the sole purpose of being toxic
* Generally being a **Not Nice Person**

Will severely hinder and/or outright get you banned from contributing to the project. If you feel like someone has treated you unfairly _based on **who you are as a person**_, contact that person and work it out _outside this platform_. If that doesn't work, get in contact with us and alert us to the problem. **Whatever you do, do not make a scene, as that will burden the entire community with your issue.** Be the bigger person, say your piece privately, and don't dwell on it.

## **3.) The only thing that matters is _The Codebase_**
If it doesn't apply to the Codebase, it doesn't belong here. We will use every tool we have at our disposal to try and veer a conversation back on topic, and failing that, put the dumpster fire out. These discussions drag on and _on_ and _**on**_, and they don't make communities better. We are not in the business of policing people's personal lives outside this tiny sliver of the internet, we are here for **this specific Codebase** and _nothing more_. If you are so stuck that a member of our community does or is something you don't like elsewhere, then you should probably not be here.
